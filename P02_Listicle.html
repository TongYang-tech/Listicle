                    <p2 class="paragraphs">I've always wanted to try this place out for awhile now and we finally got around to doing so. 100% 
                                           should have come here WAY sooner. Love this place and will be coming back a lot! I came with three 
                                           other people and were lucky to find a table inside but there is some outdoor seating avaliable. 
                                           Inside, there are about three 4-person tables and maybe 3-4 more 2-person tables. Outdoor seating 
                                           is quite plentiful. You order at one window and pick it up at another. Food is extremely well 
                                           priced and well portioned! The big dishes are definetly enough to feed ya. The medium sized dishes 
                                           are about 15-20% smaller but it filled up my gf and my mom and dad pretty well. They have a bunch of 
                                           drinks too (boba) but we did not try those. I got the curry over rice with the chicken cutlet. 
                                           SOOO GOOD. The chicken was phenomenal and so crispy. Paired with the curry it was even better. 
                                           Food came out fast and all servers were extremely helpful and friendly!

                <h4 class="headingList"><span class="numList">3.</span>Kung Fu Tea</h4>
                    <p3 class="paragraphs">Generally speaking, Kung Fu Tea scores 5, but it's usually a low 5, considering that it's a massive 
                                           international corporate chain, whose milk teas don't match up to the best chains: Sharetea, Gong Cha 
                                           and Coco. However, they're still really good, and the fruit teas here are among the best. Especially 
                                           the lemon black tea which absolutely rocks my world. If it's not on the menu, demand it! Other fruit 
                                           teas (Berry, Orange, Grapefruit) must also be ordered off-menu as Black Tea instead of the meh Green. 
                                           Also the Lemon Black tastes good as a Lemon Oolong, but everyone else hates it because they have bad taste.
                                           This KFT is located right in the heart of everything, and this is the perfect location for a college 
                                           town Kung Fu Tea. It's on State Street alongside all of the mostly pedestrian-only thoroughfares which 
                                           the college kids wander and walk and look for eats & drinks that will excite them.

                    <p4 class="paragraphs">I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars. This place was incredible the 4x we went. You MUST order 
                                           the authentic Chinese dishes here. The oxtail and tripe with chili oil is so delicious, fresh, tasty and 
                                           was loaded with fresh cilantro.My chef husband is very adventurous, so he ordered that, and to be honest 
                                           the tripe sounded scary, but, It was beautiful when it arrived, I tasted it and it blew me away.... and 
                                           I feel the same way about the beef roll, scallion pancakes, soup dumplings and the bokchoy with mushroom. 
                                           I'm a foodie and have been a chef  on charter boats for high end clients, and LOVE cooking and food is my life. 
                                           I HIGHLY recommend eating here, just order TRADITIONAL CHINESE, ppl!!
